# ML-ECU
Machine Learning project on predicting vehicle source ECU from CAN voltage signal
The ML models for this project where writen in Python 3.6 or later.

These files have the extension .py and require Python 3.6 or later to be properly
downloaded and installed on the PC attempting to run the model. 

It is assumed that the user running this model has existing knowledge of Python 
and how to install modules.

The following modules need to be installed for the .py files to run properly. They
can be installed by running each line at the CMD prompt:

>pip install pandas
>pip install numpy
>pip install scikit-learn
>pip install matplotlib
>pip install pathlib

The python files (Method_1.py and Method_2.py) need to be executed
from the same file directory that the DATA.csv file is located. 

There is a third .py file named "Data_Processing.py". This file is not to be
executed. It is only there to show how the data was initially preprocessed.
It can be opened and viewed in any coding IDE. 

Also included in this zip file is the powerpoint slides from the final presentation,
the Latex final report PDF and the Zip folder for Overleaf.
